# Hi, I'm Mohit! 👋
#### ℹ️ Product Manager turned AI Vibecoder | 0-to-1 Builder | Data Strategist

### 👨‍💻 **About Me**

I am a **Product Manager** with 5 years of experience bridging the gap between Product Strategy and Engineering Execution. I specialize in scaling high-velocity exchanges and architecting data infrastructure for FinTech and Web3 products.

### 📊 **The Number Slides (Impact at Scale)**

| Metric | Achievement | Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$117M+** | **Peak AUM** | Scaled **Efficacy Labs/Kriya** liquidity pools via UI/UX & incentives. |
| **5X** | **Volume Growth** | Drove transaction volume scale-up in <3 months prior to asset listing. |
| **20X** | **User Scale** | Scaled **GIVA** App DAUs from 2K → 40K via behavioral data loops. |
| **500K** | **Users Served** | Architected SQL infra for **Canvas AI** to automate enterprise analytics. |

### 🎯 Current Explorations

I am exploring deeper into **Technical Product Management & AI Engineering**, building autonomous agents and backend workflows.

- 🔭 Architecting an autonomous AI research agent designed to clone my own research workflows using Python, LangGraph, Supabase (Memory), Telegram Interface. A "human-in-the-loop" agent that autonomously browses, summarizes, and synthesizes complex crypto/AI market reports.
- 💼 Exploring other gen AI tools and cooking up a new product.
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** I have an International FIDE Chess Rating of **1440**. Feel free to hit me up for a chess match anytime if you are around Bangalore.
